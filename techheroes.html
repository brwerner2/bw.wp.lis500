				<img src="Dean-Mark.jpg" alt="Mark Dean" style="float: right; margin: 20px; width: 425px;">
				<p>Mark Dean is a tech hero because his work fundamentally shaped how personal computers function and how accessible they became to everyday users. As an engineer at IBM, he co-invented the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus, a breakthrough that allowed computers to be modular, supporting add-on hardware like printers, disk drives, graphics cards, and monitors. This innovation transformed the PC from a closed system into a flexible platform, laying the groundwork for the customizable computers that dominate homes, schools, and workplaces today. Dean also holds dozens of patents related to computer architecture and played a leadership role in developing the first gigahertz processor, a major milestone that dramatically increased computing speed and performance.</p>
				<p>Beyond his technical achievements, Mark Dean is a hero in tech because of what his career represents. As a Black innovator working at the highest levels of engineering, he broke barriers in an industry where Black contributions have often been overlooked or underrecognized. He has also been a vocal advocate for diversity and education in STEM, emphasizing the importance of inclusion in shaping the future of technology. Mark Dean’s legacy is not just the hardware he helped build, but the example he set, showed that impactful, system-level innovation and leadership can come from voices that have historically been excluded from the tech narrative.</p>
